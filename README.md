## 🦠 Project Title / Headline
COVID-19 India Tracker: State-Wise Daily Trends Dashboard
An interactive Python-based dashboard that visualizes daily COVID-19 case trends across Indian states — enabling real-time insights into infection patterns, recovery rates, and regional comparisons.

## 🎯 Short Description / Purpose
This project provides a clean, data-driven interface to monitor the spread of COVID-19 across Indian states. It helps users analyze daily confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases, empowering public health analysts, researchers, and citizens with timely insights.
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 🐍 Python – Core programming language for data processing and visualization
• 📊 Pandas – For data manipulation and transformation
• 📈 Matplotlib / Seaborn – Used to generate visual plots of daily trends
• 🧪 Jupyter Notebook / Streamlit (optional) – For interactive exploration or deployment
• 📁 File Format – CSV dataset (IHHPET.csv) and Python script (app.py) for logic and visuals
## 📚 Data Source
Source: IHHPET.csv — a state-wise daily COVID-19 dataset
The dataset includes daily records of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases across Indian states, structured in a time-series format for trend analysis.
## 🔍 Features / Highlights
• Business Problem
During the COVID-19 pandemic, decision-makers and the public needed a reliable way to track the virus’s spread across regions. Raw data alone made it difficult to identify spikes, recovery trends, or high-risk zones.
• Goal of the Dashboard
To create a visual tool that:
- Displays daily case trends by state
- Highlights recovery and fatality patterns
- Supports comparative analysis across regions
- Enables timely decision-making for health response and resource allocation
### • Walkthrough of Key Visuals
- Line Charts:
Show daily confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases for selected states
- State Filter:
Allows users to select and compare trends across different Indian states
- Trend Analysis:
Visual cues help identify surges, plateaus, or declines in infection rates
## 📈 Business Impact & Insights
- Public Awareness: Helps citizens stay informed about their state’s COVID-19 status
- Policy Support: Assists health officials in identifying hotspots and allocating resources
- Data Transparency: Promotes open access to pandemic data in a digestible format
- Scalability: Can be extended to include vaccination data, testing rates, or forecasting models
